## What are the problems with a standard RCT?


- Poor recruitment rates
- Ignore what occurs before and during trial
- Inefficient

## What is an adaptive trial?

 
 A clinical trial design that
allows for **prospectively planned** modifications to one or more aspects of the design based on
accumulating data from subjects in the trial. 



Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry, Nov 2019

## What can we adapt? 

- Sample size
- Patient population (Adaptive enrichment)
- Treatment arm selection
- Allocation ratios
- Outcome and timepoints

## Advantages of Adaptive Trials

- Statistical efficiency
- Ethical considerations
- Improved understanding of interventions (eg sub-groups)


### Allocate more participants to better interventions


### Add new interventions when available


### Drop interventions that donâ€™t improve outcomes


### Increase/stop recruitment in subgroups


## Adaptive trials vs adaptive interventions


* eg SMART trials
* individual tailored interventions
* decisions based at the individuals(or cluster)  performance
* ignore the collective information (different aims)




## Examples ("pick the winner")

.content-box-blue[ To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a nine-valent human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine, a clinical trial with adaptive dose selection was carried out (Chen et al. 2015). The
trial randomized subjects to one of three dose formulations of the nine-valent HPV vaccine or
an active control, the four-valent HPV vaccine. An interim analysis was carried out to select
one of the three dose formulations to carry forward into the second stage of the trial. The goal
of the trial was to select an appropriate dose and confirm the safety and effectiveness of that
dose in a timely manner.]




## Response adaptive randomisation

* Multi arm trial
* Adapt allocation ratio depending on "Probability each treatment is the best"
* Continually evaluate the data (Bayesian framework)
* Information goes where it is needed
* Drop arms -> accelerates the process



## Bayesian framework

* estimating probability that a treatment is the best
* this is not effected by the number of times it is calculated - it only gets
  more accurate



## Sub-group enrichment

* some sub-groups of participants might perform better for different
  interventions
*  A platform trial adapts both the number of interventions (the ratios), and
  the sub-groups




## Disadvantages

- pre planning adaptive design modifications can require more effort at the design stage,
leading to longer lead times between planning and starting the trial.



## Opportunities in implementation trials


### Outcomes can be fast


### Uncertainty in treatments




### Prior data often available


### Multi-stage processes that can be combined into a single on-going study


### Embedding trials into routine care



## Example: optimising implementation bundles

* A number of components in an implementation bundle
* Traditional approach -  not feasible to perform a large multi factorial trial
