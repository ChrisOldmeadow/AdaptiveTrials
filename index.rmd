# What are the problems with a standard RCT?



- `r emo::ji("demon")` Poor recruitment rates
- `r emo::ji("demon")`  Ignore what occurs before and during trial
- `r emo::ji("demon")`  Ineffecient

# What is an adaptive trial?

.content-box-blue[ 
 A clinical trial design that
allows for **prospectively planned** modifications to one or more aspects of the design based on
accumulating data from subjects in the trial.

- Sample size
- Patient population (Adaptive enrichment)
- Treatment arm selection
- Allocation ratios
- Outcome and timepoints



---

 
# Advantages

- Statistical efficiency
- Ethical considerations
- Improved understanding of interventions (eg sub-groups)


---
# Allocate more participants to better interventions


---
# Add new interventions when available



---
# Drop interventions that donâ€™t improve outcomes



---
# Increase/stop recruitment in subgroups


---

# Change primary endpoint during the trial

# Examples

.content-box-blue[ To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a nine-valent human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine, a clinical trial with adaptive dose selection was carried out (Chen et al. 2015). The
trial randomized subjects to one of three dose formulations of the nine-valent HPV vaccine or
an active control, the four-valent HPV vaccine. An interim analysis was carried out to select
one of the three dose formulations to carry forward into the second stage of the trial. The goal
of the trial was to select an appropriate dose and confirm the safety and effectiveness of that
dose in a timely manner.]

# Dissadvantages

- preplanning adaptive design modifications can require more effort at the design stage,
leading to longer lead times between planning and starting the trial.

---

# Testing a multi-component resource package to improve the wellbeing of carers of people with dementia


- tailored resource package for carers of people with dementia 
- reducing symptoms of concern (for the PWD)
- reducing anxiety and dperession (for the carer)

---
# The intervention components

- Taylored assistance based of areas of need
- face-to-face group sessions
- bi-weekly brief symptoms assessment to identify any new areas of need


---
# Is this trial suitable for an adaptive design?


- slow recruitment `r emo::ji("+1")`
- outcome assessed quickly `r emo::ji("question")`


---
# What could we adapt?

- The intervention components? 
- a multi-arm study?

-  the full intervention is too costly to be cost-effective
- What is the least effective dose (non-inferior to full)

## Optimising by forward increments

|                   | phase 1| Phase 2 | Phase 3| Phase 4 |
|-------------------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
|  Min         | x|x |  |  | 
|   inc 1           |  |  |x |  |
|   inc 2           |  |  |  |x | 
|   inc 3           |  |  |  |  |
|   Full            | x|x |x |x |
| Ctr (usual care)  | x|x |x |x |

| Ctr (usual care)  | x|x |x |x |

--
 phase 1 we would compare:

* Min vs Usual Care : superiority
* Min vs full : non-inferiority

--
At the next phase, 
* Drop *Min* if probability of being superior to ctrl is *low*, with a new arm 
* Drop *Min* if probability of non-inferiority to full is *low*, and a ( a higher intervention dose is then added) 
* if either of these are uncertain then they remain in the trial, recruiting more units
